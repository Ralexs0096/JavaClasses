         *  Why we use StringBuilder?
         *
         *  when working with `Strings`, and doing a lot of text modifications
         *  or concatenations, using `String` may not be efficient.
         *  This is because each time the text is modified a new object is created,
         *  and this consumes memory and processing time.
         *
         *  in the other hand, `StringBuilder` can modify the same object multiple times
         *  without create a new object on memory.
